if MagicMirror stops working suddenly:
--> check disk usage (command: "ncdu" in main folder): cd MagicMirror 
ls -l
look for core file (log-file), it sometimes gets huge and trashes the sd-card, 
	no space left then
rm core 

or:

rm -r /home/pi/.pm2/logs/mm-out-0.log --> delete file


shutdown:
go on mobile page:192.168.0.6:8080/remote.html

for no logs start mirror with: 
pm2 start mm -o "/dev/null" -e "/dev/null"
